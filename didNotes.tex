\section{Intro}

This is a reading note for \textit{Difference-in-difference: a
practitioner's guide} \parencite{Baker.etal2025}. First, let's list DID design from simple
to difficult:
\begin{itemize}
  \item basic \( 2 \times 2 \) DID design (with covariates)
  \item many time periods, with different treat times, treatment
    turned on and off
  \item multiple or continuous treatments
\end{itemize}

接下来，我们尝试思考一些问题：
\begin{enumerate}
  \item properties of RA, IPW and DR estimators (unbiasedness, consistency)
  \item inference, how to compute standard errors and do asymptotic inference for the estimators
  \item problems of using event-study regression coefficients to check PT
  \item how to check PT under staggered DID with covariates
  \item problems with TWFE incorporated with covariates
  \item multiple/continuous/turned-on-and-off treatments
  \item DID with IV\@?
\end{enumerate}

最后，尝试写一个假设/定理
\begin{assumption}[No anticipation, NA]
  For all treated units $i$ and pre-treat periods $t=0$, there is
  $$
  Y_{i,t}(1) = Y_{i,t}(0)
  $$
\end{assumption}
